Welcome to the website of Raspberry Pi OS System Administration with systemd!

In this three volume series of books, you'll find a lot of useful
information about how a beginner can do system administration on their
Raspberry Pi. 

We will post solutions to In-Chapter Exercises, advisories, errata,
and Python3, and Bash shell script code found in each book
here on or about November 1, 2023. This is the expected release/publication date
of the hardcover, paperback, and e-copy of of Volume 1.  We'll also provide links
to reference materials you can use to go beyond what we present in the
books.

Till then, keep checking back here for more information and content!

And have fun with your Raspberry Pi!

Bob
